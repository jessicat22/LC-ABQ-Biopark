LC Pipeline

Background
ABQ BioParkâ€™s LC Pipeline is intended to streamline the processing of data for widely distributed species in preparation for submission of Least Concern assessments to the IUCN Red List. The script is intended to scrape a variety of sources for data, parse point data, and return spreadsheets formatted for upload using SIS Connect. The script is not intended to be a substitute for human assessors and all assessments generated using the tool will require review according to the regular processes outlined in the IUCN Red List Rules of Procedure.
